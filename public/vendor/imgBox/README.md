Another lightbox alternative?

Yeah, we have lots of those, I know. but what I was after was a simple and
beautiful lightbox plugin that will have this neat zoom effect and slideshow
capabilities (previous/next controls), using jQuery and Sass would be cool and
yeah, it better be free and open source.

The original imgBox v1 was a good start - it had the zoom effect, was using
jQuery and licensed as open-source.
What I did was first update it to the most recent jQuery, add the slideshow
feature, then style it using the power of Sass, a few tweeks here and there,
and there it is:

<div align="center">
  <h2>
    <a href="http://tsi.github.com/jQuery.imgBox/">
      jQuery.imgBox v2.x
    </a>
  </h2>

  <em>oh and yeah, it is free and open source.</em>
</div>
